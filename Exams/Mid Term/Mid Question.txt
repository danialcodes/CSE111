You are given a list of courses that are currently available in BRACU that 
looks like the following:

courses = ['CSE110','CSE111','MAT620','CSE520','EEE361','CSE650','MAT510'].

All courses till 400 level (499) are for the undergraduate students whereas 
any courses above 500 are for the graduate or masters students.

Write a python program that creates a dictionary from the above list where 
the keys will be each department name (CSE,EEE,MAT for the above example) 
and their values will be a dictionary of two keys -
Undergraduate Courses and Graduate Courses.

Each key will have courses that fall in Undergraduate and Graduate level 
respectively.

Sample Input - No need to take input

['CSE110','CSE111','MAT620','CSE520','EEE361','CSE650','MAT510']

Sample Output: (You just have to print the resultant dictionary. No need to 
follow the pattern below)

{
     'CSE':{
         'Undergraduate':['CSE110','CSE111'],
         'Graduate':['CSE520','CSE650']
     },
     'EEE':{
         'Undergraduate':['EEE361'],
         'Graduate':[]
     },
     'MAT':{
         'Undergraduate':[],
         'Graduate':['MAT510','MAT620']
     }
}
