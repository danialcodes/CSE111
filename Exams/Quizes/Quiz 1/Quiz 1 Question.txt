Suppose you have a list of integers. Your task is to create a dictionary 
which will have the index of the list as key and product from start to that 
index as value. User will give a range and if you have to print the product 
of the list from the start and ending index of the range using the created 
dictionary.

List = [3,1,5,4,6,7,8]
Dictionary should be dict = {0:3, 1:3, 2:15, 3:60, 4:360, 5:2520, 6:20160}

Sample Input:
3,1,5,4,6,7,8
2 4

Sample Output:
{0:3, 1:3, 2:15, 3:60, 4:360, 5:2520, 6:20160}
120

Hint: If you want to get the product from index 2 to 4, just divide the 
dict[1] from dict[4] and you will get the required answer
